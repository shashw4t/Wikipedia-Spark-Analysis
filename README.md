# Wikipedia-Spark-Analysis
Analyzing full text wikipedia articles via Spark

Project for Big Data Class
In this assignment, you will get to know Spark by exploring full-text Wikipedia articles. Gauging how popular a programming language is important for companies judging whether or not they should adopt an emerging programming language. For that reason, industry analyst firm RedMonk has bi-annually computed a ranking of programming language popularity using a variety of data sources, typically from websites like GitHub and StackOverflow. See their top-20 ranking for June 2016 as an example.

We'll use our full-text data from Wikipedia to produce a rudimentary metric of how popular a programming language is, in an effort to see if our Wikipedia-based rankings bear any relation to the popular Red Monk rankings.
